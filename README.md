# Personal Website

Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page) theme.

To-Do:

- [ ] Copy over blog posts and reformat everything ðŸ˜¬
- [ ] Move over Projects
- [ ] Add to Hobbies
- [ ] Add CV somewhere
- [ ] Add text to "About" page

---

Notes

I would like to have the comments theme (either light or dark) reflect that of the website, but implementing this is beyond my current skill level.
Future Josh can give it a shot.

# Personal Website

Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page) theme.

To-Do:

- [ ] Copy over blog posts
  - [x] Copy over posts and get Hugo running
  - [ ] Check styling of all posts
  - [ ] Align on tags and categories
  - [ ] Make "Series" of some of the posts:
    - [ ] Riddlers
    - [ ] PyMC Splines
  - [ ] Reduce image/asset sizes
- [ ] Move over Projects
- [ ] Add to Hobbies
- [ ] Add CV somewhere
- [ ] Add text to "About" page

Notes

I would like to have the comments theme (either light or dark) reflect that of the website, but implementing this is beyond my current skill level.
Future Josh can give it a shot.

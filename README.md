## Notes

### Initial creation

Steps for creating website:

```bash
hugo new site jhrcook-website
cd jhrcook-website
git init
```

Blowfish theme:

```bash
git submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git themes/blowfish

```

### Updating

#### Blowfish theme

For updating ([instructions](https://blowfish.page/docs/installation/#installing-updates))

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

Can find the maximum Hugo version in the file [./themes/blowfish/config.toml](./themes/blowfish/config.toml).

Can then install this version of Hugo with the following steps:

1. Download the release from here: <https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases> â€“ make sure to download the "hugo-extended" asset
2. Extract
3. Move the `hugo` executable to `~/.local/bin/`
4. May need to allow use of the downloaded binary in System Settings/Security

Finally, set the desired version of Hugo in the [netlify.toml](./netlify.toml) and GitHub Actions [workflow](.github/workflows/gh-pages.yaml)

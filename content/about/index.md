## Introduction

My name is Joshua Cook and I am Computational Genomics Research Scientist at [Vertex Pharmaceuticals](https://www.vrtx.com) in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.
This page is meant as a brief introduction to my background.
If you have further questions or want to get in touch, please use the links on the homepage to contact me!

## Education

{{< timeline >}}

{{< timelineItem icon="graduation-cap" header="University of California, Irvine" subheader="B.S. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology; B.S. Chemistry" >}}

2013 â€“ 2017 <br>

I double majored in Molecular Biology and Chemistry, while conducting research in the <a href="https://lodoenlab.bio.uci.edu">Lodoen Lab</a> on the interactions between the parasite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"><i>Toxoplamsa gondii</i></a> and the human innate immune system (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M117.793281">publication</a>).

2017 â€“ 2023 <br>

I earned my Ph.D. through the research I performed in the labs of <a href="https://www.haigislab.org">Kevin Haigis</a> and <a href="https://compbio.hms.harvard.edu/index">Pater Park</a> studying cancer genetics. I also pursued a particular interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics">Bayesian statistical modeling</a>.

{{< timelineItem icon="email" header="Vertex Pharmaceuticals" subheader="Computational Genomics Research Scientist" >}}

2023 - Current <br>

I provide computational and analytic support to multiple gene editing therapy programs including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy">Duchenne muscular dystrophy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle_cell_disease">sickle cell disease</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_diabetes">type 1 diabetes</a>. I collaborate with wet-lab scientists to design and execute experiments as well as on-board new technologies such as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0739-1">Slide-seqV2</a> and <a href="https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/visium-hd-spatial-gene-expression">Visium HD</a> spatial transcriptomics.

## Skills

{{< alert icon="code" >}}
**Python, R, Rust, and Swift programming**
{{< /alert >}}

I am proficient in Python and R programming, with a particular specialization in data science, though I use Python often to build tools for a variety of tasks.
I am currently learning Rust and have experience with Swift for iOS, macOS, and watchOS development.

**Bayesian data analysis**
{{< /alert >}}

In graduate school, I discovered a passion for Bayesian statistics.
Below is a project page I put together collating as many of my Bayesian analyses as I could.
Currently, my job does not directly utilize this specific skill set, but Bayesian statistics still influences my reasoning process.

## Hobbies and Interests

Outside of work and programming, I try to get outdoors as much as possible, namely though **hiking, camping, backpacking, running, and fishing**.

When the weather turns here in Boston, I spend my time indoors by exercising, reading, tying flies, and tending to my plants.

Any amount is appreciated, *your support really means a lot*.
I have a few different ways you can send me a few bucks, so choose whichever medium you prefer.

This site also uses **Amazon Affiliate Program links**.
The prices on the items are unaffected and I don't receive any information about you, using these links just tells Amazon that you heard about the product through me and I earn a small commission if you purchase the item.
You can support me by doing your Amazon shopping through the link below.
Again, it doesn't change your experience (or prices) shopping on Amazon, I just get a small commission.

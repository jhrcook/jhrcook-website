## *Mad Enchantment*

**Ross King** <br>
Rating: 4.0 / 5

Another great biography by Ross King of a singularly great individual in an extraordinary time, this time following Claude Monet as he works on his final masterpiece during World War I.
Other than some over-tedious recounting of finances and some tangential visitors, King presented this narrative in an engaging and informative manner.
Reading this was an inspiring start to 2025.

## *The Man With the Golden Gun*

**Ian Fleming** <br>
Rating: 3.75 / 5

Another fun original novel, the last of Fleming's *James Bond* series.
I feel no need to provide much commentary on this classic, but I will note for my future retrospection that it was a nice, simple read while under evacuation for the Eaton Canyon Fire in January 2025.
Specifically, it felt appropriate that this be the book I read in my childhood bed with just my flashlight as a distraction from the anxiety and powerlessness.

## *Operation Mincemeat*[^1]

**Ben Macintyre** <br>
Rating: 4.25 / 5

This is my first of what I can only hope will be many of Macintyre's espionage biographies.
He masterfully organizes the multi-pronged story into a novel-esque thriller.
Full of detail and background, it was easy to keep the characters and plot organized in my head.
This famous story is worth reading by anyone who enjoy's spy-thriller novels, fiction and non-fiction, alike.
(Funny enough, having just gotten into the Bond series, Ian Fleming plays a role in the real Operation Mincemeat.)

[^1]: If you enjoyed the book, don't bother with the recent Netflix move. I was looking forward to enjoying what I expected to be a high-quality movie based on this book, but was completely disappointed by the incredible deviation from the original story. I fail to understand why the director, writers, etc. thought they needed to make such dramatic alterations, but they made massive changes to the plot and characters, including an underlying tension between Montagu and Cholmondeley (and random sexual scenes that were just distracting and added nothing of value). I didn't finish the movie because, as it strayed further from the true story as it went along, I was worried it would disrupt my memory and recall of the true events.

## *Depth Charge*

**Jason Heaton** <br>
Rating: 4.0 / 5

Overall, this book delivers on the promise of a dive-themed thriller.
It's not the world's greatest thriller, but you definitely get what you paid for.
The plot is intriguing and fun, the characters are well-defined (though I had difficulty telling some of them apart at the beginning).
It was a quick read and I enjoyed it.

I came to this book as a fan of the author, Jason Heaton's, podcast [*The Grey Nato*](https://thegreynato.com), curious to read his first novel.
He clearly took to heart the "write what you know" advice – diving, watches, Sri Lanka, Land Rovers and Land Cruisers, winter in the MidWest, and even being left-handed.
While perhaps distracting at times, as a fan, it was fun to get these little "shout-outs" sprinkled throughout the novel.
Yet, while I generally enjoyed the writing style, there were places where the prose was a bit clunky, particularly when the author needed to provide technical background information (*e.g.*, on saturation diving).
The style would jump from a narrative to a non-fiction, informational tone and back.
I look forward to reading Heaton's follow-on novel, *Sweetwater*.

## *The Nazi Conspiracy*

**Brad Meltzer & Josh Mensch** <br>
Rating: 2.5 / 5

I am somewhat torn on how to review this book.
It wasn't bad, it just wasn't what was advertised by the subtitle "The Secret Plot to Kill Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill."
Of course, the Nazi plot was discussed, but most of the book was about the scheduling and running of the meeting of the Big Three Allied Forces leaders in Tehran.
The authors provided good background on the war (though there were some miscellaneous tangents on various battles and events in WWII) and the decisions made leading up to and at the conference, but the assassination plot was really a minority of the book.
In fact, there was very little information on the conspiracy at all, mostly a spattering of pieces of the puzzle without a primary narrative.
So while it was a fairly quick and engaging read, I felt like it didn't deliver on the promise of the title, subtitle, summary, and many many cliff-hanger and foreshadowing statements.
And that brings me to another annoyance I had with the book: it's a series of short (1-3 pages) chapters with a paragraph of lead-in and lead-out, usually a not-so-subtle foreshadowing of great intrigue to come.
I'm not against using short paragraphs, but it is a style that requires great skill that I think the authors were unable to capture.
Also, the foreshadowing was very aggressive in promising incredible tales of espionage and plot-twists with very little follow-through.
In fact, it may be in part while I feel like this book under-delivered – almost every paragraph ended with such great expectations.

Overall, I would recommend reading this if you are interested in the meeting of these three WWII leaders and some of their interplay, but if you come in expecting a tale of espionage of the likes of Ben McIntyre, you will be disappointed.

## *Undaunted Courage*

**Stephen Ambrose** <br>
Rating: 4.5 / 5

This vivid and engrossing account of one of history’s greatest adventures was exactly what I needed to escape the bitterness of a New England winter.
Ambrose’s meticulous research and masterful storytelling strike a fine balance between detail and momentum, sustaining a spirit of exploration and adventure across nearly 500 pages – without a dull or unnecessary paragraph.
The author’s insights into the thoughts and motivations of the captains, crew, and Indians add depth to the narrative.
When the historical record is silent, he offers well-reasoned conjecture, always distinguishing it as such.
These moments feel like the informed musings of a seasoned professor, filling gaps where primary sources fall short.
Ambrose’s criticism is measured and fair.
He acknowledges the moral failings of figures like Lewis, Clark, and Jefferson without resorting to the reductionist labels so common of modern authors.
His portrayal of interactions with Indians is equally nuanced, presenting acts of generosity and cruelty on both sides.
For anyone interested in U.S. history, exploration, or adventure, *Undaunted Courage* is an exceptional read.

## *The Founding Fish*

**John McPhee** <br>
Rating: 4.25 / 5

McPhee's gift for transforming a single subject into a fascinating book never fails to impress.
This time, a fish.
Not a brilliantly colored fish, nor an anatomically bizarre one. Not poisonous, not venomous. Just a fish — a shad.
A species most people will never think about, let alone know in great detail.
Yet McPhee crafts a compelling narrative around the American shad, blending natural history with his own experiences fishing for and studying the species.
With characteristic precision, he explores its anatomy, behavior, and life cycle, while also tracing its notable role in American history.
I'm confident in predicting that if you like McPhee or fishing, you'll like this book.

## *Live and Let Die*

**Ian Fleming** <br>
Rating: 4.0 / 5

Another quick read of a classic Bond novel.
I'm not a greater reviewer of fiction and, given the popularity of this series, I don't feel I would add much value in attempting to do so.
I will say that I enjoyed the faster pace after two longer biographical tales.

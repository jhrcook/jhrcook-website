## *Mad Enchantment*

**Ross King** <br>
Rating: 4.0 / 5

Another great biography by Ross King of a singularly great individual in an extraordinary time, this time following Claude Monet as he works on his final masterpiece during World War I.
Other than some over-tedious recounting of finances and some tangential visitors, King presented this narrative in an engaging and informative manner.
Reading this was an inspiring start to 2025.

## *The Man With the Golden Gun*

**Ian Fleming** <br>
Rating: 3.75 / 5

Another fun original novel, the last of Fleming's *James Bond* series.
I feel no need to provide much commentary on this classic, but I will note for my future retrospection that it was a nice, simple read while under evacuation for the Eaton Canyon Fire in January 2025.
Specifically, it felt appropriate that this be the book I read in my childhood bed with just my flashlight as a distraction from the anxiety and powerlessness.

## *Operation Mincemeat*[^1]

**Ben Macintyre** <br>
Rating: 4.25 / 5

This is my first of what I can only hope will be many of Macintyre's espionage biographies.
He masterfully organizes the multi-pronged story into a novel-esque thriller.
Full of detail and background, it was easy to keep the characters and plot organized in my head.
This famous story is worth reading by anyone who enjoy's spy-thriller novels, fiction and non-fiction, alike.
(Funny enough, having just gotten into the Bond series, Ian Fleming plays a role in the real Operation Mincemeat.)

[^1]: If you enjoyed the book, don't bother with the recent Netflix move. I was looking forward to enjoying what I expected to be a high-quality movie based on this book, but was completely disappointed by the incredible deviation from the original story. I fail to understand why the director, writers, etc. thought they needed to make such dramatic alterations, but they made massive changes to the plot and characters, including an underlying tension between Montagu and Cholmondeley (and random sexual scenes that were just distracting and added nothing of value). I didn't finish the movie because, as it strayed further from the true story as it went along, I was worried it would disrupt my memory and recall of the true events.

## *Depth Charge*

**Jason Heaton** <br>
Rating: 4.0 / 5

Overall, this book delivers on the promise of a dive-themed thriller.
It's not the world's greatest thriller, but you definitely get what you paid for.
The plot is intriguing and fun, the characters are well-defined (though I had difficulty telling some of them apart at the beginning).
It was a quick read and I enjoyed it.

I came to this book as a fan of the author, Jason Heaton's, podcast [*The Grey Nato*](https://thegreynato.com), curious to read his first novel.
He clearly took to heart the "write what you know" advice – diving, watches, Sri Lanka, Land Rovers and Land Cruisers, winter in the MidWest, and even being left-handed.
While perhaps distracting at times, as a fan, it was fun to get these little "shout-outs" sprinkled throughout the novel.
Yet, while I generally enjoyed the writing style, there were places where the prose was a bit clunky, particularly when the author needed to provide technical background information (*e.g.*, on saturation diving).
The style would jump from a narrative to a non-fiction, informational tone and back.
I look forward to reading Heaton's follow-on novel, *Sweetwater*.

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1649929399l/60784360._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *The Nazi Conspiracy*

**Brad Meltzer & Josh Mensch** <br>
Rating: 2.5 / 5

I am somewhat torn on how to review this book.
It wasn't bad, it just wasn't what was advertised by the subtitle "The Secret Plot to Kill Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill."
Of course, the Nazi plot was discussed, but most of the book was about the scheduling and running of the meeting of the Big Three Allied Forces leaders in Tehran.
The authors provided good background on the war (though there were some miscellaneous tangents on various battles and events in WWII) and the decisions made leading up to and at the conference, but the assassination plot was really a minority of the book.
In fact, there was very little information on the conspiracy at all, mostly a spattering of pieces of the puzzle without a primary narrative.
So while it was a fairly quick and engaging read, I felt like it didn't deliver on the promise of the title, subtitle, summary, and many many cliff-hanger and foreshadowing statements.
And that brings me to another annoyance I had with the book: it's a series of short (1-3 pages) chapters with a paragraph of lead-in and lead-out, usually a not-so-subtle foreshadowing of great intrigue to come.
I'm not against using short paragraphs, but it is a style that requires great skill that I think the authors were unable to capture.
Also, the foreshadowing was very aggressive in promising incredible tales of espionage and plot-twists with very little follow-through.
In fact, it may be in part while I feel like this book under-delivered – almost every paragraph ended with such great expectations.

Overall, I would recommend reading this if you are interested in the meeting of these three WWII leaders and some of their interplay, but if you come in expecting a tale of espionage of the likes of Ben McIntyre, you will be disappointed.

## *Undaunted Courage*

**Stephen Ambrose** <br>
Rating: 4.5 / 5

This vivid and engrossing account of one of history’s greatest adventures was exactly what I needed to escape the bitterness of a New England winter.
Ambrose’s meticulous research and masterful storytelling strike a fine balance between detail and momentum, sustaining a spirit of exploration and adventure across nearly 500 pages – without a dull or unnecessary paragraph.
The author’s insights into the thoughts and motivations of the captains, crew, and Indians add depth to the narrative.
When the historical record is silent, he offers well-reasoned conjecture, always distinguishing it as such.
These moments feel like the informed musings of a seasoned professor, filling gaps where primary sources fall short.
Ambrose’s criticism is measured and fair.
He acknowledges the moral failings of figures like Lewis, Clark, and Jefferson without resorting to the reductionist labels so common of modern authors.
His portrayal of interactions with Indians is equally nuanced, presenting acts of generosity and cruelty on both sides.
For anyone interested in U.S. history, exploration, or adventure, *Undaunted Courage* is an exceptional read.

## *The Founding Fish*

**John McPhee** <br>
Rating: 4.25 / 5

McPhee's gift for transforming a single subject into a fascinating book never fails to impress.
This time, a fish.
Not a brilliantly colored fish, nor an anatomically bizarre one. Not poisonous, not venomous. Just a fish — a shad.
A species most people will never think about, let alone know in great detail.
Yet McPhee crafts a compelling narrative around the American shad, blending natural history with his own experiences fishing for and studying the species.
With characteristic precision, he explores its anatomy, behavior, and life cycle, while also tracing its notable role in American history.
I'm confident in predicting that if you like McPhee or fishing, you'll like this book.

## *Live and Let Die*

**Ian Fleming** <br>
Rating: 4.0 / 5

Another quick read of a classic Bond novel.
I'm not a greater reviewer of fiction and, given the popularity of this series, I don't feel I would add much value in attempting to do so.
I will say that I enjoyed the faster pace after two longer biographical tales.

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391440316l/18668059._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *The Obstacle is the Way*

**Ryan Holiday** <br>
Rating: 3.0 / 5

This is the first book in Holiday’s trilogy on practicing Stoic philosophy.
While it aims to be quick and practical — distilling key Stoic tenets into actionable advice — the writing is too simplistic.
It reads like a high-school essay on ethics and hard work: repetitive, lacking nuance, and overly straightforward.
The book offers some useful insights, but most come from quotes or anecdotes about historical figures.
Holiday adds little original value, instead padding key ideas with analogies, famous stories (sometimes tenuously linked), and restatements with added overly-intense emphasis.
It’s a short read — I finished it in a few days while splitting time with another book — but it could have been distilled further, perhaps into a handful of quotes or a one-hour podcast.

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1587627766l/33929._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *Eight Little Piggies*

**Stephen Jay Gould** <br>
Rating: 4.5 / 5

Another solid collection of essays on natural history by a great writer and thinker of the modern era.

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312053568l/6516340._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *Half Moon*

**Douglas Hunter** <br>
Rating: 3.25 / 5

Douglas Hunter offers a detailed and accurate account of Henry Hudson’s voyage aboard the *Half Moon* as he searched the east coast of North America for a route to the Northwest Passage.
Unfortunately, few records of the journey—particularly the exploration itself—survive.
As a result, much of the book focuses on aspects I found less engaging, such as financial backing and Anglo-Dutch politics.
In contrast, the more compelling elements—Hudson’s thoughts, the sailors’ conflicts, and encounters with native peoples—are sparse and largely speculative, pieced together from scattered accounts often written years later.
The writing is thorough and of high quality, but the book seems more suited to readers interested in the early era of the Dutch East India Company than to amateurs seeking an exciting tale of exploration.
Thus, my 3.5-star rating reflects unmet expectations rather than a flaw in the book’s execution.

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388215989l/3750._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *Moonraker*

**Ian Fleming** <br>
Rating: 4.25 / 5

Moonraker is the first Bond novel I can (with some hesitation for fear of sounding elitist) say I genuinely enjoyed — not just as part of the iconic franchise, but as a solid story on its own.
The writing feels more polished and engaging, the plot more compelling and less cartoonish, and Bond himself more interesting.
The usual flair and exaggerated twists remain, preserving the classic Bond thriller style, but here they feel more restrained and, thus, effective.

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320471617l/110890._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *The Looming Tower*

**Lawrence Wright** <br>
Rating: 4.5 / 5

I was in first grade on 9/11, making me one of the younger Americans to remember the attack.
I recall understanding the broad strokes of what happened, but of course was unaware of the details of the complicated geopolitics.
From there, I grew up with the various wars in the Middle East against a variety of Islamist groups, but never had a clear picture of what really happened.
Further, the background on bin Laden, Al Qaeda, and the Taliban was always blurry, as was the controversy over how such an attack eluded the U.S. intelligence agencies.
Over the years, I've heard miscellaneous statements about oil, "they hate our freedom," jihad, etc., from political pundits and commentators but had a very poor understanding of this ongoing, nebulous conflict.
*Looming Towers* is the first comprehensive description of the rise of modern extreme Islamism leading up to 9/11 that I have ever received.
The author did well to provide a narrative over the decades, across nations, turmoil in the Middle East, and various extremist factions and leaders.
This book seems like a great place to start for an introduction to the battle between the West and modern extremist Islamism, providing a good foundation for further reading and education.

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459114043l/27036528._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *Ego Is the Enemy*

**Ryan Holiday** <br>
Rating: 2.0 / 5

Another mediocre addition to the trilogy of Holiday's work on Stoic philosophy (I was given the whole trilogy and so I'll finish it, still).
It wasn't horrible, I think the teachings are generally good, but it could have been summed up in a pamphlet – so the low rating is more about it just wasn't worth the time to read the whole thing.
In essence: "Ego is the enemy. For everything you do, ask is this for my ego or for my purpose?"
My two major gripes don't change much from before.
First, the writing is surprisingly poor.
As with the first book, *The Obstacle Is the Way*, it comes off as a high-schooler's attempt to write inspirational prose.
It is incredibly repetitive and excessively emotive.
My second issue with this series is that Holiday uses a lot of examples as evidence, but I don't get the sense that he performs thorough research to support his claim.
Generally, Holiday will describe a famous person's accomplishment and claim it was because he or she avoided succumbing to his or her ego (or the inverse where the antagonist falls to ego), but he doesn't link the two, he just declares the cause was related to ego.
Of course, this style of argumentation is biased towards survivors, too, but even in cases where it goes against his narrative, Holiday just claims that was the exception.
So not only is it very simplistic use of "evidence," he cherry picks the stories.
In addition, he uses these examples as evidence or data when they are just selected anecdotes.
Again, I don't disagree with the author's recommendations, it's just that the argumentation is weak, silly, and often distracting.
My last comment will be that, I understand writing a book on the importance of humility makes one an easy target for criticism, but Holiday does himself no favors by putting his face on his podcast artwork and most Youtube thumbnails and putting up videos of him reading and running – just feels like there are some simple ways to reduce his ego.

## *The Wall Street Journal Guide to Information Graphics*

**Dona M. Wong** <br>
Rating: 3.75 / 5

Simple enough read and will serve as a useful reference.
The guidelines and recommendations were predominately written for the visualization of financial data, but the underlying principles were broadly applicable.
I would recommend starting with Tufte's classics, but this was a good addition.

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474479671l/31934105._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *The Social Transformation of American Medicine*

**Paul Starr** <br>
Rating: 3.25 / 5

This book was clearly written for an academic audience.
It thoroughly documents the the U.S. medical system from the very founding to just before modern day (the epilogue touches on some of the twenty-teens).
Going in, I was expecting more about the *practice* of medicine rather than a discussion on the *system* of medicine.
It is difficult to give this a relatively low rating as I think my incorrect expectations are partially to blame in not enjoying this book, but it was just so dry at times.

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266608757l/4243744._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *The Art and Science of Fly Fishing*

**Lenox Dick** <br>
Rating: 4 / 5

This was a simple, if outdated, overview of the fundamental techniques of fly fishing.
While still a fun read, I think many of the techniques popular today were developed after its publication in the 70's.
Dick has a fun writing style, very conversational.
The book reads like a small-group lecture, and parts of the book are written from the point of view of a trip with a friend.
I found this in a used-book store a while back and it was a fun read in preparation of spring.

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1502143372l/35414997._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *Rocket Men*

**Robert Kurson** <br>
Rating: 4.5 / 5

*Rocket Men* was a thrilling recounting of the Apollo 8 mission to orbit the moon.
Kurson wonderfully weaves many narratives and histories into a single exciting, page-turning story.
The writing is very focussed and comes from secondary resources, as well as first-hand interviews with many of the astronauts and key mission control personnel.
Another interesting facet of the story was the impact that such a risky expedition had on the families back on earth.
Kurson expertly balances the tone between informative and thrilling.

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440633220l/3760._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *Diamonds Are Forever*

**Ian Fleming** <br>
Rating: 3.75 / 5

I took this next novel in the original Bond series with me to the White Mountains for a weekend of backpacking and fishing (or at least waving a stick in the air). Over the bus rides and through some afternoon rain, I read this in just a few sittings. I'm not a literary expert, but in my opinion, this book demonstrated clear advancements in Fleming's style and prose. The description of settings and emotions were more subtle and interpretable. I enjoyed the plot and characters and am looking forward to the next.

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1610894755l/54968118._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *The Code Breaker*

**Walter Isaacson** <br>
Rating: 3.5 / 5

I had been wanting to read an Isaacson biography for awhile, so, as a biologist at a pharmaceutical company working on gene therapies, I figured the one on CRISPR would be a good place to start.
This was an oddly organized book: it felt like Isaacson really wanted to tell Doudna's story, but most of the book is on CIRSPR more broadly.
I think this was for the better.
While undeniably intelligent and hard-working, it doesn't seem like Doudna is the quirky, eccentric genius that we love to read stories about.
The feeling I came away with was that she had a pretty normal up-bringing, got into chemistry and biology, worked hard, and executed – a powerful story, but not an especially thrilling one.
So after a mediocre beginning to the book, the recounting of the discovery and manipulation of CRISPR technology was very interesting.
Isaacson did a tremendous job of interviewing the key players multiple times, posing difficult questions, and organizing everything into a cohesive storyline.
While perhaps too much in some cases, I also appreciated when the author would insert his own point-of-view into the text, particularly when there were competing narratives from individuals and a historian's skill-set can help disambiguate between them.
My main critique on the book would be the rather lack-luster final third or so of the book.
Some of this section was a series of thought experiments on the potential uses of CRISPR; while perhaps interesting in small doses, there were too many and I was more interested in learning about CRISPR.
The rest of the final third was about COVID-19.
I think when this book was published in 2021, the author thought COVID would still be interesting, but in 2025, it isn't really.
Furthermore, I don't think CRISPR has much of a role in testing, treating, etc. for COVID, so its inclusion felt forced and off-topic.
Overall, I would recommend this for anyone who wants to learn more about the history of the CRISPR technologies, at any level of familiarity, but not necessarily as a book about Jennifer Doudna.

## *Slouching Towards Bethlehem*

**Joan Didion** <br>
Rating: 3.0 / 5

I had heard praise for Joan Dideon's work from a variety of people whose opinions I respect, so I was excited to find this old copy of *Slouching Towards Bethlehem* in a used bookstore in Redding, CA.
Pretty early on into this collection of short stories, I realized it wasn't for me.
The writing is phenomenal, but the topics were uninteresting.
I completed the book, but was generally underwhelmed by the stories.
I feel out of line giving such a low rating to a highly regarded author, but I just couldn't get into the essays and short stories.

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442830952l/25776132._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *The Brain*

**David Eagleman** <br>
Rating: 3.75 / 5

Simply, this book was a good introduction into the primary structure and function of the brain.
The author describes in clear, jargon-free prose the phenomena of the brain, how it interfaces with senses, how it creates a sense of mind, its incredible plasticity and adaptability, etc.
This book was written to be readily understood by anyone and was a quick, yet enjoyable, weekend read.

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1700961214l/737957._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling*

**Ross King** <br>
Rating: 4.5 / 5

This was another delightful art history narrative by Ross King, this time about Michelangelo's creation of the fresco adorning the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.
As in his previous works, King melds a description of the artwork with the contemporary social and political context.
Descriptions of Michelangelo's background, his fresco technique, and intentions in the design of the Sistine's ceiling, were augmented by the impacts of Pope Julius II's fiascos and conquests, the competition with up-and-comer Rafael, and broader restructuring throughout Italy.
I would highly recommend this book to anyone soon to visit Rome and the Vatican – I wish I had read this before my trip last year.

## *Doctor No*

**Ian Fleming** <br>
Rating: 3.5 / 5

Another fun, borderline absurd, Bond novel.

<br>

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390628825l/57336._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *Dinosaur in a Haystack*

**Stephen Jay Gould** <br>
Rating: 4.25 / 5

Solid collection of essays from Gould.
Not much to say specifically about the contents of the book, but I will note that I finish each essay in a more curious, thoughtful mindset.
A terrific way to start the day.

## *Goldfinger*

**Ian Fleming** <br>
Rating: 3.25 / 5

As I continue through the Bond series, this was a new height of absurdity.
Having now read the original, it is surprising how little Austin Powers strayed from the text.

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 15px"><img border="0" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1614968763l/18085401._SX98_.jpg"/></a>

## *The Sleepwalkers*

**Christopher Clark** <br>
Rating: 4.0 / 5

In *The Sleepwalkers*, Clark provides a detailed account of the lead-up to World War I from the perspective of every major player in the eventual conflict.
He begins by describing the diplomatic connections between all of the involved countries decades before the conflict, eventually showing how these political relationships between the countries, cultures, and heads of state resulted in a such a fiasco.
I turned to this book as preparation for a trip to Germany (that I was unable to take) because I realized my understanding of WWI was woeful.
I was surprised and, at times, overwhelmed by the detail and complexity of Clark's narrative, particularly, the first third or half of the book focussed on the politicians and diplomats of the Baltic states.
I failed to grasp many of these details, but I gained a better understanding and appreciation of the cause of WWI by patiently working my way through this book.
While feeling fairly academic at times, I would easily recommend this book to anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation as myself and wants somewhere to start (though I hope you get to go on your trip).

## *For Your Eyes Only*

**Ian Fleming** <br>
Rating: 3.75 / 5

A departure from the rest of the novels in the original Bond series, *For Your Eyes Only* is a collection of short stories featuring the famed secret agent.
I would have preferred to know this before starting because by the third story I was very curious to know how these disparate story lines were to connect and culminate together.
I needed an easy read amongst all the travel, job changes, moving and this fit the bill.
A bit more serious than most of the previous novels - especially *Goldfinger* - it felt like Fleming was experimenting with different types of story lines and adventure themes.

## *Smarter Faster Better*

**Charles Duhigg** <br>
Rating: 3.5 / 5

On the tidal wave that was *The Power of Habit*, Duhigg has produced another digestible and anecdote-organized guide to productivity.
This time, instead of how to build better habits, *Smarter Faster Better* is specifically how to organize and orient oneself and teams to consistently produce above-average results.
Similar as before, I found the book long-winded at times, yet informative.
There were nuggets of wisdom mixed in with the pages of narrative.
And as before, I eventually got tired of the anecdotes as I went through the book and began to skim more freely.
Definitely worth reading and taking some notes, but perhaps should have been shorter.

## *The Flight of the Iguana*

Rating: 3.75 / 5

I happily stumbled on this one in the $1 bookshelf outside Commonwealth Books near Boston Commons shortly before leaving Boston.
Having enjoyed the *Song of the Dodo*, this was a no-brainer.
Like any other collection of short stories and essays, there were ups and downs.
I was expecting a style more akin to Stephen Jay Gould, though I realize that is a tremendously high bar.
Instead, the rigor was more relaxed and focused on the story and human elements than the detailed biology.
I skipped through some of the stories on topics that didn't interest me (primarily non-animal focussed) and thoroughly enjoyed others.
Overall, I enjoyed reading an essay to start and finish the day.

## *The Mysterious Case of Rudolf Diesel*

**Douglas Brunt** <br>
Rating: 4 / 5

Brunt did a wonderful job of weaving the tale of discovery, a changing world, and mystery into one.
His inclusion of the cultural and technological shifts in Europe were essential for understanding the progress of the Diesel engine and the potential explanations for the disappearance of Mr. Diesel.
This was simultaneously an informative and entertaining book, well researched and written.

## *The German Genius*

**Peter Watson** <br>
Rating: 3.75 / 5

Admittedly, I did not know how thick and academic this book was before I purchased it.
It ended up being quite the undertaking as a layman.
This book covers the last couple centuries of notable German artists, authors, musicians, philosophers, scientists, and more.
Each player is expertly placed in historical context with an explanation of how he or she furthered the cultural changes that are noticeable in hindsight.
Personally, I was most interested in the scientists and philosophers, but the parts about the other "geniuses" provided insight into the German culture and progress of the time period.
I originally began this book as preparation for a trip I was planning to Germany in October of 2025 that I ended up not being able to take, still *The German Genius* was a great guide for understanding German history outside of just WWII.

## *Don Quixote*

**Miguel de Cervantes** (translated by Edith Grossman) <br>
Rating: 3.75 / 5

Admittedly, I read this because I received it as a gift and feel it right to only retain a book in my library if I read it. By today's standards, *Don Quixote* is long-winded and dry, but as a historic book, it is interesting to see the origins of modern fictional literature. Upon finishing the pair of volumes and reflecting on the main themes, I did find richer insights weaved into the narrative. These 1,000 pages were an endurance test and not the most enjoyable novel to read in the present day, but I have a bit of pride from getting through it and feel that reading these classics is inherently enriching and valuable.

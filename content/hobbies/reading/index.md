{{<lead>}}I start every day with coffee and a book.{{</lead>}}

I read as a way to continually learn.
As a student, this allowed me to diversify my areas of study, and after finishing my many years of formal education, I read to resist from stagnation.
Importantly, to learn does not require only reading non-fiction.
I believe there is plenty to be learned by great fiction.

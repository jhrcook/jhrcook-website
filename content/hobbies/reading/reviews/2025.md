## *Mad Enchantment*

**Ross King** <br>
Rating: 4.0 / 5

Another great biography by Ross King of a singularly great individual in an extraordinary time, this time following Claude Monet as he works on his final masterpiece during World War I.
Other than some over-tedious recounting of finances and some tangential visitors, King presented this narrative in an engaging and informative manner.
Reading this was an inspiring start to 2025.

## *The Man With the Golden Gun*

**Ian Fleming** <br>
Rating: 3.75 / 5

Another fun original novel, the last of Fleming's *James Bond* series.
I feel no need to provide much commentary on this classic, but I will note for my future retrospection that it was a nice, simple read while under evacuation for the Eaton Canyon Fire in January 2025.
Specifically, it felt appropriate that this be the book I read in my childhood bed with just my flashlight as a distraction from the anxiety and powerlessness.

## *Operation Mincemeat*[^1]

**Ben Macintyre** <br>
Rating: 4.25 / 5

This is my first of what I can only hope will be many of Macintyre's espionage biographies.
He masterfully organizes the multi-pronged story into a novel-esque thriller.
Full of detail and background, it was easy to keep the characters and plot organized in my head.
This famous story is worth reading by anyone who enjoy's spy-thriller novels, fiction and non-fiction, alike.
(Funny enough, having just gotten into the Bond series, Ian Fleming plays a role in the real Operation Mincemeat.)

[^1]: If you enjoyed the book, don't bother with the recent Netflix move. I was looking forward to enjoying what I expected to be a high-quality movie based on this book, but was completely disappointed by the incredible deviation from the original story. I fail to understand why the director, writers, etc. thought they needed to make such dramatic alterations, but they made massive changes to the plot and characters, including an underlying tension between Montagu and Cholmondeley (and random sexual scenes that were just distracting and added nothing of value). I didn't finish the movie because, as it strayed further from the true story as it went along, I was worried it would disrupt my memory and recall of the true events.

## *Depth Charge*

**Jason Heaton** <br>
Rating: 4.0 / 5

Overall, this book delivers on the promise of a dive-themed thriller.
It's not the world's greatest thriller, but you definitely get what you paid for.
The plot is intriguing and fun, the characters are well-defined (though I had difficulty telling some of them apart at the beginning).
It was a quick read and I enjoyed it.

I came to this book as a fan of the author, Jason Heaton's, podcast [*The Grey Nato*](https://thegreynato.com), curious to read his first novel.
He clearly took to heart the "write what you know" advice â€“ diving, watches, Sri Lanka, Land Rovers and Land Cruisers, winter in the MidWest, and even being left-handed.
While perhaps distracting at times, as a fan, it was fun to get these little "shout-outs" sprinkled throughout the novel.
Yet, while I generally enjoyed the writing style, there were places where the prose was a bit clunky, particularly when the author needed to provide technical background information (*e.g.*, on saturation diving).
The style would jump from a narrative to a non-fiction, informational tone and back.
I look forward to reading Heaton's follow-on novel, *Sweetwater*.

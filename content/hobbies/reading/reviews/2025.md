## *Mad Enchantment*

**Ross King** <br>
Rating: 4.0 / 5

Another great biography by Ross King of a singularly great individual in an extraordinary time, this time following Claude Monet as he works on his final masterpiece during World War I.
Other than some over-tedious recounting of finances and some tangential visitors, King presented this narrative in an engaging and informative manner.
Reading this was an inspiring start to 2025.

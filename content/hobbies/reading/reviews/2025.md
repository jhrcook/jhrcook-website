## *Mad Enchantment*

**Ross King** <br>
Rating: 4.0 / 5

Another great biography by Ross King of a singularly great individual in an extraordinary time, this time following Claude Monet as he works on his final masterpiece during World War I.
Other than some over-tedious recounting of finances and some tangential visitors, King presented this narrative in an engaging and informative manner.
Reading this was an inspiring start to 2025.

## *The Man With the Golden Gun*

**Ian Fleming** <br>
Rating: 3.75 / 5

Another fun original novel, the last of Fleming's *James Bond* series.
I feel no need to provide much commentary on this classic, but I will note for my future retrospection that it was a nice, simple read while under evacuation for the Eaton Canyon Fire in January 2025.
Specifically, it felt appropriate that this be the book I read in my childhood bed with just my flashlight as a distraction from the anxiety and powerlessness.

## *Operation Mincemeat*

**Ben Macintyre** <br>
Rating: 4.25 / 5

This is my first of what I can only hope will be many of Macintyre's espionage biographies.
He masterfully organizes the multi-pronged story into a novel-esque thriller.
Full of detail and background, it was easy to keep the characters and plot organized in my head.
This famous story is worth reading by anyone who enjoy's spy-thriller novels, fiction and non-fiction, alike.
(Funny enough, having just gotten into the Bond series, Ian Fleming plays a role in the real Operation Mincemeat.)

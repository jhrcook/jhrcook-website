In 2021, (ironically) sick of living in a half-closed city and working from my bedroom everyday, I stumbled upon the backpacking hobby.
It looked like the perfect escape.
I became immediately obsessed and convinced myself to buy the necessary equipment and prepare for a trip that fall with my roommate and his dog.
In October, we went to the White Mountains and followed the Isolation Loop trail.
It was difficult, but I had a great time.
I specifically recall leaving on the third day with what I would describe as incredible mental clarity â€“ not in the way to declare that I had everything figured out, but that the noise and background that had me feeling "congested" had finally been cleared.
I was hooked.

Since then, I have gone on a few trips and done some simple camping at the local state park in Wompatuck.
More than anything, I have developed a better appreciation for just being outside for extended periods of time.
Going on longer hikes, longer runs, staying out fishing for the entire afternoon, etc.

Below are some photos from my backpacking trips followed by a list of my favorite pieces of gear for those interested.

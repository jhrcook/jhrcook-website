In 2024, I embarked on a journey to learn the Rust programming language, driven by a desire to challenge myself and explore uncharted territories.
Rust, a systems-level language, offers a plethora of benefits over languages I am already familiar with like Python.
Its allure lies in the promise of faster start-up and run-times, greater resource efficiency, and a more straightforward deployment process.
In addition to these technical advantages, if not because of them, my motivation was also in the pursuit of a skill that holds significant value in todayâ€™s job market.

As I delved into the intricacies of Rust, I found myself appreciating its unique characteristics and the discipline it imposed.
Unlike higher-level languages, Rust requires a meticulous approach to memory management and concurrency, elements that are often abstracted away.
This hands-on control not only sharpened my programming skills but also provided a deeper understanding of the systems that underpin modern software.
I have learned and practice Rust development through a series of smaller projects and purpose-built courses, but now, as I contemplate the next steps in my journey, I am eager to apply my newfound knowledge to real-world projects.

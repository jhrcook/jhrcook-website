This section of the website if for organizing resources I find myself reaching for frequently and those I have created myself.
Examples of the former include data visualization reference websites, and of the latter include my notes in *Deep Work* by Cal Newport.
I'm sure I'll make great use of this collation, and hopefully others can find information they didn't know they were looking for.

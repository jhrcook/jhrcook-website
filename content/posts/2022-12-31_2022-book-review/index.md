I think I was successful, definitely improving over the previous year, and I finished [24 books this year](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/32619604).
Below is a review of my favorite books from this year in order of how fondly I look back on them.

## 1. [*My First Summer in the Sierra*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2116294.My_First_Summer_in_the_Sierra)

author: [John Muir](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5297.John_Muir)

{{< alert icon=null >}}
Ranks number one because I read this right before a trip to Yosemite with my girlfriend and experienced the majesty of the sierras that Muir documented.
{{< /alert >}}

John Muir, famous naturalist and author, maintained a diary (later published as this book) on his first summer in the Sierra mountains in central California.
He described the scenery, plants, and animals with such awe and prestige, the I couldn't help but hold the region in high regard.
Reading Muir's writings prior a trip to Yosemite with my girlfriend in the spring of this year enriched the entire experience noticeably as it framed the trip with a sense of adventure and appreciation of the natural wonder.[^1]

[^1]: I also read [*Off the Wall: Death in Yosemite*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/673812.Off_the_Wall?ref=nav_sb_ss_3_12), a recounting of the known deaths in Yosemite National Park which added a different flair to the trip. In all honesty, it's a very interesting book and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning their trip.

## 2. [*Down the Great Unknown*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/438097.Down_the_Great_Unknown)[^2]

[^2]: The full title is *Down the Great Unknown: John Wesley Powell's 1869 Journey of Discovery and Tragedy Through the Grand Canyon*.

author: [Edward Dolnick](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11059.Edward_Dolnick)

{{< alert icon=null >}}
Ranks number two because it is a detailed yet gripping retelling of a great American adventure.
{{< /alert >}}

This book detailed the trip lead by John Wesley Powell, eccentric professor, down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, definitely the first for a non-Native American to the region, and perhaps the first for man judging by the accounts of native peoples contacted in preparation for the trip whole wholly regarded it as a suicide mission.
The author is thorough in description of the time, the men, the various simultaneous storylines, but this book reads fast as there is an overwhelming sense of adventure thread throughout.

## 3. [*Meat Eater*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17262207-meat-eater)[^3]

[^3]: The full title is *Meat Eater: Adventures from the Life of an American Hunter*.

author: [Steven Rinella](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/267770.Steven_Rinella)

{{< alert icon=null >}}
Ranks number three because it inspired in me a sense of exploration in the modern world.
{{< /alert >}}

Many of the tales of adventure are written in a world that no longer exists â€“ see the first two books in this list.
In *Meat Eater*, Rinella tells of a diverse array of adventures he has taken at every stage of his life in the modern world, in times and places that are accessible to the common man.
While this book is an easy read, it remains thought-provoking and insightful as it is much a story of exploration of the natural world as it is an exploration of a maturing man.

## 4. [*Coolidge*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18085413-coolidge)

author: [Amity Shales](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/101131.Amity_Shlaes)

{{< alert icon=null >}}
Ranks number four because it is a well written recounting of an oft overlooked yet respectable president.
{{< /alert >}}

We never learned about Coolidge in school; he was skipped jumping from T.R./Wilson/WWI to Hoover/The Great Depression/WWII.
Yet, he was a remarkably unremarkable president as he is one of the first modern Republicans (that is, a limited-government politician in the era of big government).
I didn't know much about his life or presidency, and Shales provided a clear, concise portrayal.

## 5. [*The Nazi War on Cancer*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/251213.The_Nazi_War_on_Cancer)

author: [Robert N. Proctor](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/146786.Robert_N_Proctor)

{{< alert icon=null >}}
Ranks number five because, at the time I was finishing up my Ph.D. researching cancer genetics, and this was a peak into a bizarre period in the field's history.
{{< /alert >}}

Historical reports of the Nazis are often, quite rightly, focussed on the slaughter of millions of innocents, predominately the antisemitic attempt to "cleanse" the world of the Jews.
While that part of history is important to remember and study, *The Nazi War on Cancer* instead turns its attention to the study of cancer in early 1900's Germany, a society at the vanguard of science and engineering.
I happened across this book as I was preparing to write by Ph.D. dissertation on cancer genetics and it was, rather unsurprisingly, a fascinating read that covered critical and influential stages in the history of the field[^4].

[^4]: [*Blitzed*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29429893-blitzed) is another wild book about an obscure portion of Nazi history: their use of amphetamines during the war.
